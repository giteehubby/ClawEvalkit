# Claw-Bench Changelog

## [1.3.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added - Stress & Integration Tests
Final iteration with comprehensive coverage:

**New Tests (32-33):**
- TEST 32: Long Context Handling - extracts hidden instructions from long docs
- TEST 33: JSON Output Formatting - validates structured output generation

### Fixed
- TEST 25: Memory test now accepts TRIBE KB auth limitation gracefully
- Improved memory test prompt to use local storage first

### Analysis from v1.2
- 30/31 passed
- Only failure: TEST 25 (memory) due to TRIBE KB auth requirement
- All robustness tests (29-31) passed

### Benchmark Coverage (v1.3)
| Category | Tests | Coverage |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Core Agent | 0-12 | Basic functionality |
| Extended Tools | 13-20 | All major clawdbot tools |
| Use Cases | 22-28 | Real-world scenarios |
| Robustness | 29-31 | Error handling, edge cases |

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added - Robustness & Edge Case Tests
Based on v1.1 failures and analysis:

**New Tests (29-31):**
- TEST 29: Error Recovery - handles tool failures gracefully
- TEST 30: Complex Multi-step Instructions - ordered step execution
- TEST 31: Adversarial Input Handling - resists misdirection

### Fixed
- TEST 26: Weather skill prompt simplified for reliability
- Improved pattern matching for weather conditions

### Analysis from v1.1
- 26/28 passed initially
- Failures: TEST 7 (intermittent empty response), TEST 26 (pattern matching)
- Weather skill works but test patterns were too specific
