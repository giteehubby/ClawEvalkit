## Leaderboard

Browse the full leaderboard and individual task cases at **[claw-eval.github.io](https://claw-eval.github.io)**.

**Evaluation Logic (Updated March 2026):**

* **Primary Metric: Pass^3.** To eliminate "lucky runs," a model must now consistently pass a task across **three independent trials** ($N=3$) to earn a success credit.
* **Strict Pass Criterion:** Under the Pass^3 methodology, a task is only marked as passed if the model meets the success criteria in **all three runs**.
* **Reproducibility:** We are committed to end-to-end reproducibility. Our codebase is currently being audited to ensure **all benchmark results on the leaderboard can be verified by the community**.
* **Handling API Instability**: In the event of execution errors caused by network or API fluctuations, we manually re-trigger the evaluation to ensure exactly **3** trajectories are successfully generated.


## 📢 Updates
* **v1.1.0** — 300 human-verified tasks in 9 categories: Agents perceive, reason, create, and deliver.

* **v1.0.0** — Built on reproducible real-world complexity.
* **v0.0.0** — From chatbot to real world. (2026.3)



## Tasks

300 tasks across 3 splits and 9 categories, each task with human-verified rubrics.

| Split | Count | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `general` | 161 | Core agent tasks across communication, finance, ops, productivity, etc. |
| `multimodal` | 101 | Perception and creation — webpage generation, video QA, document extraction, etc. |
| `multi_turn` | 38 | Conversational tasks with simulated user personas for clarification and advice |

Agents are graded on three dimensions through full-trajectory auditing:
- **Completion** — did the agent finish the task?
- **Safety** — did it avoid harmful or unauthorized actions?
- **Robustness** — does it pass consistently across multiple trials?

### Dataset

## Quick Start

We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for fast, reliable dependency management:

```bash
pip install uv
uv venv --python 3.11
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Prepare your keys and set up the environments with one command:

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
export SERP_DEV_KEY=... # add this for tasks need real web search
bash scripts/test_sandbox.sh
```

> **Note on video fixtures:** Due to file size limits, this GitHub repository does not include video files for video-related tasks. The complete fixtures (including all videos) are available on Hugging Face: [claw-eval/Claw-Eval](https://huggingface.co/datasets/claw-eval/Claw-Eval).

Go rock 🚀

```bash
claw-eval batch --config model_configs/claude_opus_46.yaml --sandbox --trials 3 --parallel 16
```

## Roadmap

- [ ] More real-world, multimodal tasks in complex productivity environments
- [ ] Comprehensive, fine-grained scoring logic with deep state verification
- [ ] Enhanced sandbox isolation and full-trace tracking for transparent, scalable evaluation
